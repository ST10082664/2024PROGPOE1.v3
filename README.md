Welcome to my PROG POE Part 1.

Here you can find useful tips and guidances for this app. 

"yes and no" questions must be answer by typing 'yes' or 'no' with the same spelling and  size (capital or small letter).
If the input is mistyped or anything else is typed, the app will crash and data will be lost. Unfortunately!
Same rules apply for inputing a recipe name to display. 

Page 30 of the POE says: "The instructions indicate that the ingredients should be stored 
in an array since collections are only discussed in learning unit 3. 
However, if a student uses a collection, award the marks."
So I just used Collection instead of Arrays to be more practical.

My sincere apologies for not using colors and/or the poor console app display view.
I will be working on correctig that for part 2.
Same for not using GitHub.


Here is a recipe model to enter to try the application:
