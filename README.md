Welcome to my PROG POE Part 2.

Here you can find useful tips and guidances for this app. 

"yes and no" questions must be answer by typing 'yes' or 'no' with the same spelling and  size (capital or small letter).
If the input is mistyped or anything else is typed, the app will crash and data will be lost. Unfortunately!
Same rules apply for inputing a recipe name to display. 

Here is a recipe model to enter to try the application:
